      My name is Jarvis and I'm a Formula1 info bot.
      You can ask me a variety of questions, like:
      - ask for an F1 joke
      - who won a championship in a given year
      - information about a driver
      - which are the constructor's drivers (current or given an year)
      - race results (podium or driver's race outcome)
      - next race in calendar
      If you want to perform a new search, remember to ask me to reset the slots, otherwise there can be some issues.
